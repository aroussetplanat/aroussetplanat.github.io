title: "Topography of the FX Derivatives Market: a View From London"
collection: publications
category: wp
abstract: "We analyze the behavior of all financial and non-financial firms active in the UK FX
derivatives market—the largest global center for currency trading—using transaction-
level data. Based on firm-level net currency derivatives exposures, we find that UK
and EU pension funds, investment funds, insurers and non-financial corporations use
FX derivatives primarily for hedging purposes, with dealer banks accommodating these
clients’ hedging needs. In contrast, hedge funds predominantly utilize FX derivatives
to speculate, with their trading activity consistent with carry trade, momentum, and
macroeconomic news investment strategies. Lastly, the paper documents many novel
facts that should motivate theoretical models."
